// 
// This file is here simply to have a file with
// a .cpp extension. Visual studio will not enable
// the C++ property section in the project
// when there isn't a file in the project with
// this extension! Thus with the project loaded 
// up with only .cc files, it didn't know that
// C++ was needed.
